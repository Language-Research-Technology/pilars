      <h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>This document contains implementation advice and notes on the <a
href="./">PILARS Protocols</a>.</p>
<h2 id="storage-layout">Storage layout</h2>
<p>Very sensitive data may need to be stored on physically secured
storage such as hard drives stored in a safe or an air-gapped server,
and a variety of storage systems may need to be combined for a large
collection (e.g. public data stored in the cloud, access-controlled data
kept locally). Encrypting sensitive data can allow technologists to work
on the servers without being able to see the data, but the data may not
be recoverable if the encryption keys are lost.</p>
<p>Storage directory-like hierarchies may group data together in
collections or by rights-holder on similar paths; to aid in moving data
between services using file-system tools (unlike approaches which
completely obscure all meaning in paths using hash algorithms, for
reasons such as optimising the storage address space).</p>
<p>However, to avoid ambiguity in implementing <a href="./#1.2.2"
title="Each Storage Object is a directory (or storage object equivalent) containing the files including metadata and administrative files such as checksums that make up an Object.">Protocol
1.2.2</a> a specification, for example OCFL, may require that object
paths on the storage root must not be nested within each other.</p>
<p>Deciding on the granularity of objects [Protocol 1.2involves
considering a number of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Files with the same licensing conditions for re-use should be
grouped together</p></li>
<li><p>If some content may need to be withdrawn or withheld for
cultural, ethical or legal reasons, then objects should be packaged so
that this can be done without having create new versions of
objects</p></li>
<li><p>The Size of [Storage Objects] – considerthe practicality of
managing content and users who may be downloading [Storage Objects], if
the size of the objects is likely to be probalematic, consider breakingn
them into smaller</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="./#1.3"
title="Document and implement an ID resolution mapping system to map IDs to storage locations (FAIR-F1).">Protocol
1.3</a> (that an ID resolution method is in place and documented)
ensures that data can be referenced remotely and inter-object
relationships within a repository are supported (this supports <a
href="./#2.5"
title="Represent Repository Collections such as archival series or other organising entities as Storage Objects; either self-contained with their member data within the Storage Object or as metadata-only Storage Objects referencing or referenced by other Storage Objects.">Protocol
2.5</a> this means a Storage Object can be located without requiring the
repository to be indexed using the ID-to-path algorithm.</p>
<p>The Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) specification was developed to
support a similar set of requirements to <a href="./#1"
title="Data is Portable: assets are not locked-in to a particular mode of storage, interface or service">Protocol
1</a> and is being widely implemented in repository and digital library
systems. LDaCA uses OCFL and has demonstrated that it works at the scale
of tens of thousands of objects and millions of files.</p>
<p><em>OCFL is a compliant implementation solution for the data
portability</em></p>
<p>A simpler alternative storage based on different standards would be
to: - Use a directory hierarchy on a POSIX-compliant storage system -
Signal that directory is a Storage Object <a href="./#1.2"
title="Divide up data files into [Storage Objects] that form meaningful units, of smallest practical size.">Protocol
1.2</a> by the presence of a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt">Bagit</a> manifest in a
directory - Bagit files nested below this Storage Object would not be
considered Storage Objects in their own right in the context of the
repository - Bagit provides checksums as per 2.4 Store checksum-metadata
in a documented standard format alongside data to help ensure data
integrity - Use a documented and implementable algorithm to map object
IDs to a path and store a summary in the root of the directory
hierarchy</p>
<h3 id="storage-object-notes">Storage Object notes</h3>
<p>TODO: Reference OAIS concept of packages</p>
<h3 id="applications-notes">Applications notes</h3>
<p>Regarding <a href="./#1.7"
title="If data resides in systems, such as content management systems or database applications which do not inherently support all of the protocols 1 &amp; 2 then put processes in place to export data to a system that does.">Protocol
1.7</a>: Ideally this something that should not be necessary, but if not
then work to bring systems into line with PILARS: - Don’t design or
build systems that don’t have this exit pathway designed from the start
- Don’t place data in systems that don’t have this already, and - Work
to add this straight away if existing systems don’t have this.</p>
<h3 id="metadata-standards-and-specifications">Metadata Standards and
Specifications</h3>
<h4 id="why-is-linked-data-metadata-required">Why is Linked Data
Metadata required?</h4>
<p>Linked Data allows: - Any conceivable data structure to be described
in metadata, and there is no limit to the size and scope of the
description. - Extensibility: vocabularies to be mixed in as needed;
from a core set for all data to domain-specific to project or even
dataset-specific terms; this can be formalised using Profiles. -
Interoperability with contemporary global research information systems
architectures, discovery services etc. - Inter-object relationships to
be expressed – so that the physical storage layout does not define the
only way that resources can be explored.</p>
<p>NOTE: Linked data is often conflated with Open Access; the phrase
Linked Open Data is very common. But the Linked Data principles can be
applied to non-open access-controlled materials. Non-open materials have
some impact on how catalogues and indexes are implemented; for example,
using linked-data graphs such as triple stores that contain multiple
items may make access-control-safe queries impossible to implement for
reasons of complexity and performance; the reasoning to work out whether
a particular metadata statement can be seen by a particular user could
be very computationally expensive.</p>
<h4 id="vocabularies-and-metadata-profiles">Vocabularies and metadata
profiles</h4>
<p>Communities can maintain schemas/vocabularies for specific domains
(FAIR-R1.3) and to document metadata profiles.</p>
<p>Documenting a profile can be as simple as writing a natural-language
document to describe what is expected in a particular context, but can
be further codified using Linked Data Schemas (or Ontologies or
Vocabularies), from which documentation and validation services may be
derived.</p>
<h3 id="licenses">Licenses</h3>
<p>Licenses may be based on Copyright law, or rely on other mechanisms
based on other rights (such as privacy or trade secrets). Licenses
should reflect the will of rights holders, and will likely be
administered, chosen or written by a data custodian or steward
authorised to act on behalf of the rights holders, or by the rights
holder themselves.</p>
<p>It is important to have a license document independent of algorithms
or configuration file(s) and independently of a particular authorization
system that may be built into a software application. Implemented
processes are, of course, needed to make data available, and may include
some automation. But to make data truly portable across systems and
time, it is essential that human-readable documentation is available in
case authorization processes need to be rebuilt or redesigned</p>
<h3 id="logical-structure-collections">Logical Structure:
Collections</h3>
<p>The concept of a Collection is very commonly used in repositories and
digital archives to represent the ‘backbone’ of the way resources
including sub-collections and Objects are organised.</p>
<p>The choice of whether to store Collections as a single Storage
Objects (eg directories) in a storage system or as a number of Storage
Objects may be influenced by the several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The size of the object, finer granularity may be preferred to
keep Storage Objects at a manageable size.</p></li>
<li><p>How likely the content is to change or be withdrawn, for example
because a participant wishes to have content by or about them removed
from an Archival Repository, a granularity of on object per
participant/creator or cohort may make withdrawing access more
manageable, by updating a license</p></li>
<li><p>Whether there is a separation made between Archival and
dissemination-ready copies of files as per OAIS [3]</p></li>
<li><p>Whether files are stored with or separately from annotations on
those files (such as transcripts) Licensing of objects; from an
implementation point of view it is much simpler to have a single reuse
license per object than to try to administer very granular
permissions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To comply with 2.5 Represent Collections such as archival series or
other organising entities as Storage Objects … as metadata-only Storage
Objects referencing or referenced by other Storage Objects. Collection /
Object relationships may be described using either exhaustive lists of
members with a property such as the Portland Common Data Model hasMember
property or by referencing the containing Collection from another
Collection or Repository Object</p>
<p>Fragmented objects can be linked back together using the for
presentation and access (this is one of the strengths of Linked Data),
for example, a recording and verbatim transcript may be stored together
in an object available to a very limited cohort, while anonymised
transcripts and audio may be in another object made broadly available –
but these can be cross-linked and presented as a single entity to
authorised users.</p>
<p>A variety of virtual collection-like aggregations of objects can be
created via metadata indexes using user interface devices such as search
facets, to comply with the 1 Data is Portable and 2. Data is Annotated;
these should be designed so that the metadata on which they depend is
stored with the data object, not solely in an application or workspace
environment.</p>
<h3 id="governance">Governance</h3>
<p>The specifics of good governance are out of scope for these
protocols, so we confine ourselves to some notes:</p>
<p><a href="./#3.3"
title="Deposit agreements are in place and documented setting out the rights needed for the Archival Repository as an organization to manage data">Protocol
3.3</a> and <a href="./#3.4"
title="Processes are in place for disposal/deaccessioning if appropriate to the purpose.">Protocol
3.4</a> together means (at least) two things: robust appraisal or
sentencing practices, and robust preservation processes have been
established.</p>
<p>The Digital Preservation Handbook [8] has detailed practical advice
about preservation-focussed archival practice.</p>
<h2
id="compliant-pilar-software-todo---make-into-a-separate-page-on-the-rrkive-site">Compliant
PILAR software (TODO - make into a separate page on the RRKive
site)</h2>
<p>the Oni software stack used by LDaCA is based on these protocols
Other repository software solutions such as Fedora which uses OCFL as a
storage layer and its own Linked Data standards for describing
collections and objects would also be considered PILAR compliant.</p>
<h2 id="compliant-metadata-specifications">Compliant Metadata
Specifications</h2>
<p>Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) [7] is a linked-data metadata
specification based on widely used Linked Data Open Specifications.
RO-Crate was developed as a packaging method for describing datasets and
their contents – which is a good match for describing Storage Objects,
and is now being widely adopted in various research contexts. RO-Crate
has been demonstrated to work at scale in the Language Data Commons of
Australia and PARADISEC as the basis for archival-repositories.</p>
<p>RO-CRATE supports Principle 2.5 Represent collections, archival
series or other organising entities as storage-level objects … via the
inclusion of the Portland Common Data model; a schema for describing
repositories with classes for Collections, Objects and Files [5].</p>
<p>RO-Crate is a compliant choice for the A (Annotated) in a PILAR
implementation, and is used in both PARADISEC and LDaCA.</p>
<h2 id="software-implementation-approaches">Software Implementation
Approaches</h2>
<p>There are two important implementation approaches to storing metadata
in storage systems, which are discussed in this blog post: either the
metadata in the store is treated as the source of truth (this is the
approach implemented in the set of tools used by LDaCA) or a catalogue
application maintains metadata which is the source of truth and exports
data to the data store, the approach taken by PARADISEC.</p>
<p><a href="./#1.7"
title="If data resides in systems, such as content management systems or database applications which do not inherently support all of the protocols 1 &amp; 2 then put processes in place to export data to a system that does.">Protocol
1.7</a> deals with this; it is important for the overall goals of these
protocols that there are systems in place to write well described
(Annotated) data to commodity storage.</p>
