<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This document sets out protocols for the design and implementation of
sustainable Archival Repository services to achieve “CAREful FAIRness”;
i.e. to support the CARE [1] and FAIR [2] principles.</p>
<p>PILAR aims to guide the design and implementation of data storage
services, referred to as [Archival Repositories], for a range of
purposes, including core use cases of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>supporting research that follows the FAIR [2] principles in any
discipline, and</p></li>
<li><p>archiving cultural-heritage.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These protocols are designed to work alongside the CARE principles
[1] which operate at a governance level and the Reference Model for an
Open Archival Information System (OAIS) [3] model.</p>
<p>The high-level aims of these PILAR protocols are to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maximise autonomy for data custodians/stewards</p></li>
<li><p>Maximise return on investment in data and data
infrastructure</p></li>
<li><p>Maximise long-term sustainability for data and for data systems
and management</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The technical goals to support the aims are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data is portable and not locked into a particular storage
system.</p></li>
<li><p>Data can be stored and described in systems based on Open
Specifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Services such as authorised access interfaces, catalogues and
finding aids can be built and rebuilt from data in a storage system
using Open Source Software solutions, services and tools.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>This set of protocols is inspired by the continuing success of the
technical approach taken over two decades by the PARADISEC (Pacific and
Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures) [4] which
houses cultural heritage material from more than 1360 languages with
standard metadata with data stored in commodity services (initially
files on disk, now objects in a cloud storage service), with metadata
adjacent to the data, and work with the Language Data Commons of
Australia to generalise the PARADISEC approach to other disciplines.</p>
<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>
<p>These protocols are aimed at IT practitioners, archivists,
librarians, researchers and infrastructure managers involved in
long-term data management and are intended to be complementary to the
existing practices and principles of those disciplines.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>In a research context it is important to be able to support the FAIR
principles [2], ensuring that data is well described by metadata, is
identified with persistent identifiers and that shared services with
good governance are in place to store interoperable data, to make it
findable and provide appropriate access controls.</p>
<p>These protocols could form the basis for design, evaluation or
procurement of archival repository-services, but also allow for data
custodians to begin organising data in a format ready for archiving and
preservation as long as they have access to some kind of commodity
storage, by using a range of tools.</p>

<h1 id="definitions-glossary">Definitions (glossary):</h1>
<p>The following terms (used in capitalised form) are defined.</p>
<p><a name="archival-repository"> </a></p>
<h3 id="archival-repository">Archival Repository</h3>
<p>Used to cover any system that is designed to keep data securely for a
defined period of time (often forever) and to make it findable by and
available to appropriate parties. The terms Repository and Archive have
different nuances and are used in a variety of ways in different
communities, but here we want to emphasise the commonalities and focus
on advice that is relevant to the audience of these protocols.</p>
<p><a name="standard"> </a></p>
<h3 id="standard">Standard</h3>
<p>A Specification published by a recognized standards body such as the
ISO or W3C. Standards are not always Open Access, so may have barriers
to adoption.</p>
<p><a name="open-specification"> </a></p>
<h3 id="open-specification">Open Specification</h3>
<p>A versioned, published, openly available description of a set of
precise requirements (e.g., for a format, system or protocol) which may
or may not be endorsed by a standards authority. .</p>
<p><a name="open-source-software"> </a></p>
<h3 id="open-source-software">Open Source Software</h3>
<p>Freely distributable software according to the definition of the Open
Software Foundation (OSF).</p>
<p><a name="license"> </a></p>
<h3 id="license">License</h3>
<p>The term License is used here inclusively to refer to a document
which captures the terms under which data in an Archival-Repository may
be shared, used, reused or deposited. This includes documents such as
Data Sharing Agreements or other contracts which may be negotiated at
various times which give certain parties licence to use data in defined
ways.</p>
<p><a name="repository-collection"> </a></p>
<h3 id="repository-collection">Repository Collection</h3>
<p>The term Repository Collection is used here to reference the
Collection class from the Portland Common Data model[5] which was
conceived as an interchange format for repository and digital library
interchange definition for a collection includes this:</p>
<p>A Collection is a group of resources. Collections have descriptive
metadata, access metadata, and may links (sic) to works and/or
collections. <a name="repository-object"> </a></p>
<h3 id="repository-object">Repository Object</h3>
<p>The term Repository Object is used here in line with the Portland
Common Data mode definition [5] which is refers to an abstract
object.</p>
<p>An Object is an intellectual entity, sometimes called a “work”,
“digital object”, etc. Objects have descriptive metadata, access
metadata, may contain files and other Objects as member “components”.
Each level of a work is therefore represented by an Object instance, and
is capable of standing on its own, being linked to from Collections and
other Objects. <a name="storage-object"> </a></p>
<h3 id="storage-object">Storage Object</h3>
<p>A discrete unit in a physical storage service. This may represent,
for example, a Repository Object or a Repository Collection which are
abstract structural concepts. This concept is similar to an OCFL Object,
and the concept of a Package in OAIS.</p>
<p><a name="linked-data-metadata"> </a></p>
<h3 id="linked-data-metadata">Linked data metadata</h3>
<p>Metadata is data that describes other metadata. Linked Data Metadata
follows the principles set out by Tim Berners Lee for LInked data, so
that all metedata and references to entities described are URIs (URLs).
[6]</p>
<p><a name="data-steward"> </a></p>
<h3 id="data-steward-or-custodian">Data Steward or Custodian</h3>
<p>An individual or organisation with the authority to make decisions
regarding data under management. This decision making process is assumed
to take place with good governance, in line with the CARE
principles.</p>
<p><a name="file"> </a></p>
<h3 id="file">File</h3>
<p>A datastream which is addressable by name and a path within a
filesystem (eg conforming to POSIX)</p>
<p><a name="file-format"> </a></p>
<h3 id="file-format">File Format</h3>
<p>The organizational schema for a file – this may be formally defined
in a specification or be ad-hoc. File formats may considered at various
layers of specificity – for example a text file may be plain text with a
specific encoding such as UTF-8 and also be an XML file conforming to a
particular schema</p>
